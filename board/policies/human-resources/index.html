            <div>If an employee believes there has been a violation of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policy or harassment based on a protected class, including sexual harassment, please use the following complaint procedure. Douglas County Libraries (the “Library”) has established a program designed to prevent harassment, deter future harassers, and protect employees from harassment. The Library takes prompt action to investigate and/or address alleged discriminatory or unfair employment practices. The Library also takes prompt remedial actions, when warranted, in response to complaints of discriminatory or unfair employment practices. The Library therefore expects employees to make a timely complaint to enable the Library to investigate and correct any behavior that may be in violation of this policy.</div>
            <div>Report the incident to a Division Director who will investigate the matter. The employee complaint will be kept as confidential as practicable. If the employee prefers not to go to this individual with their complaint, they should report the incident to the Human Resources Manager.</div>
            <div>The Library prohibits retaliation against an employee for filing a complaint under this policy or assisting in a complaint investigation. If an employee perceives retaliation for making a complaint or participating in the investigation, please follow the complaint procedure outlined above. The situation will be investigated.</div>
            <div>Issues involving the Executive Library Director or Board of Trustees members are referred to the Board President, or if involving the Board President, the Board Vice-President. The Board President or Vice-President must refer those issues to legal counsel for consultation and investigation. The Board President or Vice-President will decide resolution, either based on legal counsel advice, or by bringing the matter before the full Board for action. For issues involving the Executive Director or Board of Trustees members covered by this process, the Board President or Vice-President must communicate the resolution of investigations to the claimant, the Board, and the Executive Library Director.</div>
            <div>If the Library determines that an employee’s behavior is in violation of these policies, disciplinary action will be taken up to and including termination of employment.</div>

            <div>Employees with direct ownership, partnership, or personal involvement in supplier companies or distribution outlets related to Library business must report their involvement and relationship to supplier companies and distribution outlets through the Library’s Conflict of Interest form.

            <div>Colorado Law Section 24-18-104, C.R.S. should be consulted in determining whether a trustee or employee may accept a gift.

          <section>
            <div>Douglas County Libraries (the “Library”) adheres to a strict Alcohol and Drug Policy for all employees and volunteers.</div>
            <div>Alert and rational behavior is required for the safe and adequate performance of job duties. Therefore, working after the apparent use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or abuse of any other substance is prohibited. Furthermore, the possession, purchase, or consumption (use) or sale of a controlled substance or alcohol on Library premises or while conducting Library business is prohibited. Employees’ compliance with this requirement is a condition of continued employment. Volunteers’ compliance with this policy is also required. Violation of this requirement for employees may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</div>
            <div>If a supervisor has a reasonable suspicion as a result of observable behaviors that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at work, or if an employee is involved in a Library-owned motor vehicle accident or an accident while on Library business, the employee may be asked to submit to an appropriate test for substance abuse. Both a positive test and a refusal to submit to such a test may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.</div>
            <div>Per the Alcohol (Social Use) Policy, the serving of alcoholic beverages on Library premises is permitted as defined in that policy.</div>
            <div>At other times, employees and volunteers may be in a social, job-related situation where alcoholic beverages are available or supplied, such as at conferences or dinner meetings. In these situations, the Library’s Alcohol and Drug Policy procedures are modified to allow consumption of such beverages as long as the level of consumption is consistent with safe and professional performance of the employee’s duties.</div>

            <div>Individuals in supervisory or managerial roles, and those with authority over others’ terms and conditions of employment, are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their status as role models, their access to sensitive information, and their ability to affect the employment of individuals in subordinate positions.</div>
            <div>This policy does not preclude or interfere with the rights of employees protected by the Colorado Labor Peace Act, Protecting Opportunities and Workers’ Rights (POWR) Act, or any other applicable statute concerning the employment relationship.

The published edition supersedes and replaces all previously issued editions and any inconsistent verbal or written statements issued prior to the publication.</div>

            <div>The Library strongly opposes sexual harassment and inappropriate sexual conduct. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</div>

            <div>All employees and non-employees, such as Board of Trustees members, volunteers, customers, vendors, and consultants, are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and businesslike manner at all times.

Each employee has the right, as an individual, to participate in public debate or to engage in social and political activity. The only restrictions on these activities are those imposed by law.

              <h4>Concerted Activity</h4>
              <div>Employees have the right to act with co-workers to address work-related issues in many ways. Employers cannot discharge, discipline, or threaten employees, or coercively question employees, related to this “protected concerted” activity. A single employee may also engage in protected concerted activity if they are acting on the authority of other employees. However, employees can lose protection by saying or doing something egregiously offensive or knowingly and maliciously false, or by publicly disparaging the employer’s products or services without relating the complaints to any labor controversy.  If employees have concerns they would like to discuss regarding workplace conditions please follow the Library’s complaint procedure.</div>

Harassment does not need to be in-person and can occur over electronic media, such as Zoom or other electronic platforms. Prohibited behavior may include, but is not limited to, the following:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Written form, such as cartoons, emails, posters, drawings, or photographs.</li>
              <li>Verbal conduct, such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs, or jokes.</li>
