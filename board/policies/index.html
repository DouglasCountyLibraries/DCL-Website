          <h3>Children and Parents Policy</h3>
          <section>
            <div>The foundation of Douglas County Libraries' (the "Library's") relationship with children is that parents and guardians are the arbiters of their children's use of the Library. As arbiters, parents and guardians manage what is appropriate for their children and family. In legal parlance, the Library does not act <i>In Loco Parentis</i>.</div>
            <ul class="no-margin-bottom">
              <li>The Library supports parents and guardians as they manage their children's use of the Library by offering controls, account information, relevant descriptions of events and services, and consultation services to align Library opportunities with a family's values and needs. Parents of children 14 years of age or younger approve or validate their children's use of a library card and account. The Library will maintain options that parents can use to manage library content for children 14 years of age or younger. The Library will inform parents and guardians about these options annually as well as when they register their children for a Library card.</li>
              <li>The Library demonstrates our commitment to children by curating content and environments specifically designed for them.</li>
              <li>Our commitment to children exists inside a foundational mission to present a world of ideas and serve our entire community. The Library will not limit every customer's choices merely because a child might access content. However, content will be placed within the recommended area of the Library using commonly accepted professional resource recommendations.</li>
              <li>The Library expects that parents and guardians are responsible for their children's choices, behavior, and well-being in the Library. If Library staff believe that a child is unattended or vulnerable, they will make a good-faith attempt to contact the child's parent or guardian before referring the matter to law enforcement.</li>

          <h3>Citizen Review Request Policy</h3>
          <section>
            <div>Douglas County Libraries (the "Library") recognizes the importance of a process that customers can use to voice opinions, ask for changes, and request redress of grievances to Library decisions. The Citizen Review Request Policy covers all facets of Library services. The Citizen Review Request process affords higher levels of management review of staff decisions to determine if those decisions were made competently and aligned with Library policy and the law. </div>
            <div>The Library's <a href="#access-policy">Access Policy</a> and other policies on facility usage set forth the Library's strong commitment to public access to Library materials and services, and, along with the other adopted policies of the Library, will be the foundation upon which any request for review shall be based.  Citizens should understand that all Library services may not appeal to each person equally, and the Library as a whole, its staff and Board of Trustees, is not a judicial body. Laws governing obscenity, subversive materials, and other questionable matters are subject to interpretation by the courts.  The Citizen Review Request Policy is intended to provide a forum for important feedback about the services the Library provides&mdash;including content creation, inventories, facilities, Library-sponsored events, displays, and limitations placed on customer access&mdash;however, a Review Request will not be reviewed based on the perceived value or lack of value of any particular material or service, or political, social, religious, or activist position of the requesting party, and rather, in keeping with the law, shall be reviewed within the overall policy direction from the Board of Trustees to the Executive Library Director and staff. </div>
            <div>Non-library sponsored events shall not be reviewed under the Citizen Review Request Policy.</div>
            <div>The Library was formed and is supported by Douglas County citizen taxpayers. While anyone may seek a citizen review, public policy requests advocating for substantive changes to Library services are the prerogative of Douglas County citizens alone. </div>
          </section>
          <section id="review-request-process">
            <h4>The Process</h4>
            <ol class="no-margin">
              <li>Citizens advocating for any change should begin with conversations with staff with expertise in the area under consideration.</li>
              <li>If a citizen doesn't achieve a satisfactory result in that dialog, they may formally initiate a written request using the <a href="../citizen-review-request.pdf" target="_blank">Citizen Review Request form</a> for review with the Executive Library Director.  The Library will generally provide a response within 21 business days from receipt of a written request to respond, but may require additional time for a voluminous request. If more time is necessary, an estimated time for response will be communicated to the citizen requesting review. The Executive Library Director will conduct any fact-finding, policy review, legal review, or other inquiries as appropriate in the preparation of the response. The Executive Library Director will provide a written response to the requesting party, if such party has provided their identifying information, and will make an informational report of the request (without identifying information) to the Board of Trustees, as an important check-and-balance on performance.</li>
              <li>Requests on the same resource will not be entertained more than once in two years. If a group of citizens initiates the same or similar request, the Executive Library Director may direct a response to all citizens included in the same or similar request.</li>
              <li>Following receipt of the Executive Library Director's response, a Citizen Review Request may be escalated to the Board of Trustees, in writing addressed to the President of the Board, if a citizen seeks a change in general policy or if a citizen believes that their request was not handled in a fashion that aligns with the Library's policies, including but not limited to its Brand promise and service commitment. The President of the Board will advise the Board of Trustees of receipt of any such request.  If a majority of the Board of Trustees requests the President to add the topic for cause to review any Library policy or staff administration of the same, or to discuss any matter identified in the request within the scope of the Board of Trustees' legislative role, the topic(s) will be added to a future Board Agenda.  However, as a non-judicial body, the Board of Trustees will not review any such request for change to policy based upon either an individual Trustee's personal beliefs or a citizen's recommendations from a political, religious, social, or activist view.  If the individual requesting review wishes to personally address the topic to the Board of Trustees during the listed Agenda item, such individual, and not just the topic of the request, shall be added to the Agenda. </li>
              <li>The Board of Trustees may determine to have a verbal or written report presented from staff involved in the review process, require a written summary of the review process, and consider application of its policies to the request.  If the Board determines in its legislative function to further evaluate policy or procedures, including any proposed amendments to the same, such discussion shall be tabled until the next opportunity for the Board to review proposed amendments for a determination. The Board makes any decisions on such citizen request by following their voting processes outlined in Board Bylaws.</li>
              <li>Requests about Library policy or performance may also be made in person at a public meeting, and the process outlined for review shall be initiated through appropriate staff. </li>
              <li>The decision concerning that resource will be shared in the Board minutes for that Board action. </li>
              <li>Resources under review per this Citizen Review Request Policy will not be removed until the decision and how the decision was made is shared with the public. Per Colorado Statute, no employee will be retaliated against for refusal to remove or restrict said item until the decision is made and shared with the public.</li>

          <section>
            <div>Douglas County Libraries (the "Library") aligns with Colorado library statutes and the First Amendment in purchasing and developing digital and physical content inventories.  Free and open access to materials is foundational to our Library's history as well as over one hundred years of library service across our County.   The Library's <a href="#access-policy">Access Policy</a> is foundational to Library collection management.</div>
            <div>Customer demand is our priority and guide in selecting and retaining items for the inventory. Library staff are charged with using usage patterns, sales data, publisher marketing investments, and customer requests to ground decisions to select, locate, and retain items.  Letting the marketplace ground curation is the best way to mitigate staff or customer pre-conceived philosophies or biases. </div>
            <ul>
              <li>Curation refers to the decision to add, retain, remove, shelve, locate, or display materials in Library inventories. The Library offers content in a variety of formats to meet customer demand.</li>
              <li>Douglas County Libraries' Archives & Local History collects and preserves historic photos and the documentary history of Douglas County, Colorado.</li>
              <li>In addition to demand, the Library will employ additional and customary professional criteria in making specific decisions about titles:
                <ul>
                  <li>Documented community needs and interests</li>
                  <li>Contemporary significance</li>
                  <li>Attention from bona-fide critics and reviewers with expertise in relevant fields </li>
                  <li>Author reputation and expertise in the field</li>
                  <li>Comprehensiveness and depth of treatment</li>
                  <li>Relationship to the existing inventory</li>
                  <li>Availability of content from sources other than purchase</li>
                  <li>Durability of the format and whether the item can meet the rigors of public use</li>
                  <li>Price and availability from our approved vendors.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div>Managing and developing Library content are operational duties. Library staff perform these duties under the direction of the Executive Library Director.

          <h3>Internet Access Policy</h3>
          <section>
            <div>Douglas County Libraries (the "Library") applies its <a href="#access-policy">Access Policy</a> commitments to internet use (Wi-Fi and technology devices), but with distinctions relevant to both legal boundaries and the digital world.</div>
            <ul class="no-margin-bottom">
              <li>The internet has been declared to be an extraordinary, unique, and unparalleled educational resource and source of knowledge and information.  Colorado has adopted specific standards related to public libraries such that children using the Library's internet may be provided internet access without accessing what the General Assembly believes to be harmful material, while securing the rights of the general adult population to be able to responsibly access internet services without certain filters.</li>
              <li>Both federal and Colorado law require internet filtering and circumstances under which the Library may remove filters. The Library will fully comply with these legal mandates (Colorado Revised Statute 24-90-601; Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Pub.L.No. 106-554).  The Library has adopted a policy of internet safety for minors (defined as any person who has not attained the age of seventeen years) to prohibit access to internet-based material that is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as defined by law.</li>
              <li>The Library does not permit illegal activities conducted through any library technology system. The Library will pursue appropriate legal action, including prosecution of suspects. Illegal activities, as defined by law, include and are not limited to accessing or trafficking in obscene content, child pornography, violations of copyright, and a variety of activities generally described as "criminal." In general, the Library expects customers will be both law-abiding and civil. As appropriate, the Library will monitor customer use of internet resources to validate system security and policy compliance.</li>

          <h3>Library Facilities and Spaces Policy</h3>
          <section>
            <div>Douglas County Libraries (the "Library") facilities are a community resource and are offered in keeping with our citizens' constitutional rights for free speech and to assemble. The Library's <a href="#access-policy">Access Policy</a> is the basis for use of Library facilities&mdash;resources made available in an equitable and impartial manner. Limitations on the use of Library facilities must reflect the <a href="#customer-code-of-conduct">Customer Code of Conduct</a> or be due to practical business needs and availability.</div>

          <section id="displays">
            <h4>Displays</h4>

            <div>The Library will make exhibit, displays, and bulletin board space available to citizens engaged in cultural, intellectual, recreational, civic, educational, or charitable activities.</div>
            <div>The Library will apply guidelines equitably to the manner, method, and timing of bulletin boards, exhibits, and displays. These guidelines may also prohibit items that are in violation of any laws&mdash;content that is obscene or deemed to be derogatory or offensive to civil standards.</div>
            <div>Use of the Library's facilities for displays, exhibits, or notices does not constitute agreement or endorsement of the views presented by the Library, its Board of Trustees, or staff.</div>

          <section id="free-speech-activities">
            <h4>Petitions and Free Speech Activities</h4>
            <div>The Library recognizes and values free speech and is cognizant of our role as a respected, impartial provider of information and services. The Library is a welcoming community space. The Library endeavors to ensure that customers can enter and exit facilities safely, unimpeded, and without being unduly hindered. Members of the public may use designated exterior areas for free speech activity, subject to time, manner, and place limitations. These time, manner, and place limitations apply to everyone at all Library locations.</div>

            <div>Douglas County Libraries limits approving requests for monuments and similar large-scale memorials on Library properties to partnerships between the Library and local governments in which a Library facility resides. The Library also requires Board approval for these requests. The Library also requires the requesting local government cover the cost of the monument along with the cost of ongoing maintenance. The Library limits monuments in keeping with space needs for the primary, missional needs of the Library. The Library may, at any time and for any demonstrated need, require partner governments to relocate any monument with appropriate notice. </div>

The Board of Trustees exercises oversight through budget stewardship, direction of the Library's business plan and review of Library policies, and performance evaluation of the Executive Library Director in following the laws of the State, the Constitution, and implementing the policies adopted by the Board of Trustees.  Any program Review Request will not be reviewed based on the perceived value or lack of value of any particular program or service, and rather, in keeping with the law, shall be reviewed within the overall policy direction from the Board of Trustees to the Executive Library Director and staff.</div>

            <h4>Communication</h4>

Library engagement of talent does not imply endorsement of any of their constitutionally protected views, speech, or associations. Any outside group requesting use of Library facilities for an event not produced by the Library shall conform to the policies and procedures regarding facility use.  Non-library-sponsored events are not screened by the Library nor is access prevented based on the "perceived value or lack of value" of such event, and are not under the sponsorship, direction, or control of the Library except in their adherence to facility use requirements. </div>
