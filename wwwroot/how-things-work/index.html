                  <li>The checkout period for Overdrive and 3M materials is set by the guest at the time of checkout for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days. Twelve titles can be checked out at a time.</li>

                <div>Guests are allowed up to 99 requests at any one time. Overdrive and 3M allow patrons to have up to 20 holds at any one time.</div>
                <h3>Renewal Limit</h3>
                <div>Library items may be renewed up to eight times. "Your Lucky Day" materials, magazines, Book Club Express Kits, eBooks and Inter-Library Loan items may not be renewed.</div>
                <h3>Circulation Policy for our Smaller Branches</h3>
                <div class="bg-info padding-15">Items from our Castle Pines, Lone Tree, Louviers and Roxborough locations do not fill holds for guests at other locations. Our smallest libraries have very limited collections intended primarily for browsing. Guests may place an item from one of those libraries on hold only for pickup at that same location.</div>
                <h3>"Your Lucky Day" Items</h3>
                <div>"Your Lucky Day" items are copies of very popular titles that do not fill holds, but are placed in the libraries for guests to browse. These items are labeled with a green shamrock, are available first-come, first-served and are not renewable. DCL staff will not hold these items and are unable to verify an item is on the shelf.</div>
                <h3>"Your Lucky Day" Movies</h3>
                <div>DCL offers many "Your Lucky Day" copies of DVDs and Blu-rays of popular films for the first two months after release. Guests may place holds on titles as soon as they are in the catalog, but typically requests are not filled during this time as all copies are in the "Your Lucky Day" collection. These requests will be fulfilled after the two month period.</div>
              </div>
              <div id="eleven" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <h3>Fines on Overdue Items</h3>
                <div>Guests will be assessed a $.10 daily fine for each overdue item with the following exceptions:</div>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Library offers a grace period for most material. Items returned or renewed within three days of the due date will not be subject to a fine. Any item going past the grace period date will be assessed a fine from the due date.</li>
                  <li>There is a $1.00 daily fine for reference materials.</li>
                  <li>Overdue Interlibrary Loan items cost $1.00 per day with no grace period.</li>
                  <li>Overdue Book Club Express Kits:
                    <ul>
                      <li>$1.00 per day with no grace period.</li>
                      <li>Missing or damaged books or guides cost $10.00 each. If a guests returns a missing item within one year from the original pickup date, $5.00 will be waived or refunded.</li>
                      <li>Lost or damaged kits will incur a $140.00 charge.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a guest accumulates a total of $20.00 or more in fines and fees, the guest cannot check out any library materials until the fine is paid down. If the total exceeds $50.00, the account may be referred to a collection agency.</p>

                <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
                <p>Materials Selection refers to the decision to add material to the collection or to retain materials already in the collection. Final responsibility for materials selection rests with the Library Director, although responsibility for recommendations may be delegated to other members of the staff. Suggestions from the public are welcome. Here are the General Principles that guide us in the Materials Selection and Retention process: The District provides a forum for gaining access to information, ideas, and promoting intellectual freedom. The following basic principles will guide its materials selections:</p>
                <p>Books and other library resources will be provided for the education, information, and recreation of all people of the community. These materials are generally purchased from mainstream publishers and distributors.</p>
                <p>Within reason, the District will make every effort to provide a balanced collection representing diverse viewpoints. Materials will not be excluded because of the origin, background or views of those contributing to their creation.</p>
                <p>Textbooks or other curriculum-related materials will be acquired only when recognized as the best source for the general public in that subject area.</p>
                <p>Each item considered for purchase or deselection will also be evaluated with respect to its:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Contemporary significance, i.e. positive attention of critics, reviews and the public.</li>
                  <li>Popular interest, whether expressed or anticipated by patron request.</li>
                  <li>Author reputation and/or authority in the field.</li>
                  <li>Clarity, accuracy and organization; comprehensiveness.</li>
                  <li>Date of publication (to maintain the most up-to-date collection while striving to preserve key works in a field).</li>
                  <li>Relationship to existing collection.</li>
                  <li>Insight into or perspective of human and social conditions.</li>
                  <li>Author being from Colorado.</li>
                  <li>Durability/Quality of the format.</li>
                  <li>Availability elsewhere in the community.</li>
                  <li>Price.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An item need not meet all of these criteria to be selected. The following policies on material selection are available for your review. If you don't see the subject you're searching for here, please ask us!</p>
              </div>
              <div id="twenty-one" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <h3>Guidelines for Books</h3>
                <p>There are several measurements we use in the selection books for the collection, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does the book fit within the "general" or "public" framework of our collection? We buy books that support the GENERAL interest and informational needs of the community. Esoteric or academic works (including many foreign language books, technical manuals and research materials) are usually ruled out for purchase for this reason. Instead, we'd borrow them from other libraries or "ILL" them for you.</li>
                  <li>Is it timely? If the work has a copyright date that's within the last 2 or 3 years, we usually consider it for purchase. If it's older, but we can identify it as a "classic," we'll probably buy it. But older books are often out-of-print, or the information they contain is dated. Under those circumstances, we would "ILL" the book.</li>
                  <li>Is it affordable? Sometimes this is difficult to determine. A book over $50 is on the edge of being too expensive for a circulating collection. But if the reviews, content or advertising for the book lead us to believe there will be a big demand for it, we'd consider buying it.</li>
                  <li>Does it contain verifiably accurate information? If it does, it's a credible information source, and we'd consider buying it. The reverse is also true: some books are published that have verifiably inaccurate information. In such a case, we'd be more inclined to borrow it than buy it.</li>
                  <li>Has it received favorable reviews in professional library journals? Then library colleagues have examined the item and determined that the book has a value for public libraries. We'll probably buy it.</li>
                  <li>Is it fiction? We'll almost always buy it if you ask for it. Even for popular titles, fiction often goes out of print rather quickly. In such cases we'll initiate an ILL for it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interlibrary Loan</h3>
                <p>If you cannot find a book in our catalog that you would like, please go to our <a href="http://catalog.douglascountylibraries.org/MaterialsRequest/NewRequest">Materials Request Form</a> or ask a librarian and we'll try to get it for you. We welcome your requests for a specific book. If the title does not fit our selection criteria, we'll request it from another library. This is called "<a href="/about-us/policies/interlibrary-loan-faqs" title="Interlibrary Loan FAQ">Interlibrary Loan</a>" or "ILL". We believe that by encouraging our patrons to participate in the collection development process, we can build a collection that will more accurately reflect the interests and information needs of our Douglas County patrons.</p>
                <h3>Purchasing a Requested Book</h3>
                <p>Douglas County Libraries has established a Collection Development Policy that follows accepted professional practice for selecting a book. If the book you request fits our policy and is available, we'll buy a copy.</p>
                <p><br />
                  It takes anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months depending on whether we purchase or ILL the title. If the item is published and available it takes an average of two weeks. If a title is not available, staff at our reference desks is ready to help you find suitable alternatives.</p>
                <p>We value your ideas and opinions, your suggestions and requests. All of them will be given consideration. We will try to have the item in your hand as soon as we can, regardless of whether we buy it or Interlibrary Loan it. Feel free to speak with your branch reference staff if you have any further questions.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="twenty-two" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel">
                <h3>Guidelines for Movies</h3>
                <p>Douglas County Libraries movie collection is designed to meet the needs and preferences of our diverse community. The District will make every effort to provide a balanced collection representing diverse viewpoints and interests and to create a collection that facilitates discovery and exploration and is in line with our Mission Statement and Core Values. Materials will not be excluded because of the origin, background or views of those contributing to their creation.</p>
                <p>When considering DVDs for purchase, review journals and on-line sources are consulted. Relevance to community needs and interests is a major factor in the selection process. Consideration is given to titles with contemporary significance, attention from critics, reviewers and patrons and those deemed to be of popular interest, whether expressed or anticipated by patron request.</p>
                <p>Blu-ray DVDs are purchased for high grossing feature films. Other popular Blu-ray titles may be purchased by Collection Development based on demand or professional judgment.</p>
                <h3>Feature Films</h3>
                <p>DCL's feature film collection contains a wide selection of feature films, including current high interest titles, classics, and foreign films to meet the diverse needs of the community. Critically acclaimed films will be emphasized in addition to award winners including major national, international, and Academy Awards.</p>
                <p>The intended audience for children's films is preschool through grade six. Selections are based on current high-interest, family-friendly and educational titles that promote children's learning and engagement. The selection criteria used are essentially the same as those used for an adult audience.</p>
                <h3>Non-Fiction Movies</h3>
                <p>Titles will be selected from a wide variety of sources and include documentaries and popular subjects. The district does not purchase DVDs that are publicized solely through infomercials or personal websites or those that are produced specifically for instructional use in classrooms.</p>
                <h3>Television Programs</h3>
                <p>Priority is given to programs that have educational value such as history, biography, travel, and documentary titles or popular television series that have won or been nominated for a major award. Consideration is given to titles with contemporary significance, attention from critics, reviewers and patrons and those deemed to be of popular interest. Special consideration will be given to popular animated series for children.</p>
                <p>Occasionally new A-V media formats are introduced into the market place. These will be studied carefully to assess their suitability for public library use and sufficient time will be allowed to determine whether they will receive widespread and lasting public acceptance before collections of such new formats are added to the library.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for Music</h3>
                <p>The primary purpose of the music collection is to provide a listening library of recordings for patrons of all ages who are interested in exploring the wide variety of music forms for educational and entertainment purposes.</p>
                <p>Ours will be a collection geared toward the general listener, and not the professional musician, nor will it be intended for use by the music scholar.</p>
                <p>The collection will have a distribution of titles from all musical styles based on the popularity of various genres, including, but not limited to blues, jazz, children's, country, religious, soundtracks, hip-hop, pop, rock, and world music. Douglas County Libraries purchases unedited versions of music CDs. Preference is given to the purchase of new titles but available older titles in high demand may be purchased or replaced. Librarians or other subject specialists will make selections through reviews, personal evaluation, and recommendations.</p>
                <p>Consideration will be given to legitimate suggestions for purchase by library users. Selection will also be dictated by the current availability of materials and the limitations imposed by budget.</p>
                <p>Douglas County Libraries will not be responsible for any damage to patron CD&nbsp;and&nbsp;MP3 players or computers that occur while playing DCL's music</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for eContent</h3>
                <p>Douglas County Libraries sees its electronic resources as an important extension of the <a href="/AboutUs/Policy/MaterialsSelection">print materials collection</a> and criteria for selection is the same as those used by the library for all types of material. Electronic resources include online databases, eBooks, digital audiobooks and video. Many resources once available only in print are now available in electronic format. Providing our patrons access to electronic resources is an integral part of Douglas County Libraries selection policies. Selections are intended to meet the educational, recreational, cultural, and informational needs of the community and must meet high standards of quality in content, expression, and format. Electronic resources enhance and supplement reference service by providing timely and versatile access to information with 24/7 availability.</p>
                <h3>Online Databases</h3>
                <p>Electronic databases extend the collection and are designed to enhance print resources but can also provide more timely information with the frequent updating of material. Some former print resources now only exist in electronic format while other electronic resources have information beyond the scope of DCL's print collection. Some databases may duplicate print resources that are then evaluated for retention. Criteria considered when selecting online databases include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cost effectiveness.</li>
                  <li>Currency of information.</li>
                  <li>Ease of use.</li>
                  <li>Speed, flexibility, and layout/appearance.</li>
                  <li>Availability of archived content.</li>
                  <li>Reduction of shelf space needed for print resources.</li>
                  <li>Availability of full-text articles that can be downloaded, printed and emailed.</li>
                  <li>Uniqueness and scope of content.</li>
                  <li>Demonstrated need.</li>
                  <li>Availability of usage statistics and other reporting features.</li>
                  <li>Availability of remote access.</li>
                  <li>Hardware and software requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Digital Audiobooks, Video, and eBooks</h3>
                <p>The criteria used for selecting digital media are the same as that used for the selection of print material. To meet the interests of the community, collection emphasis is on popular fiction and nonfiction titles in a variety of genres. Our patrons generally prefer unabridged audiobooks, thus selections are made in this format when available. Some abridged nonfiction titles may be purchased when the unabridged format is unavailable. Occasionally new electronic formats are introduced into the marketplace. These will be studied carefully to assess their suitability for public library use and sufficient time will be allowed to determine whether they will receive widespread and lasting public acceptance before these collections are added to the library.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for Graphic Novels, Comics and Manga</h3>
                <p>The purpose of the graphic novel/comic/manga collection is to provide patrons with core and popular items to enjoy. The collection is composed of both recreational reading and informational titles and spans the traditional age ranges of juvenile, young adult and adult. The collection also aims to encourage reluctant readers and those reading below level to utilize the materials for educational and entertainment purposes. When considering titles for purchase, standard review journals are consulted as well as other newspaper and magazine reviews and online sources. Items that are submitted through Materials Requests are sent directly to CD for review. The availability and cost for items will also be factors in determining whether or not to make a purchase. Preference is given to new, age appropriate, well reviewed, and/or award winning materials. Items to fill in missing volumes of a series, as well as suitable selections from other series with older pub dates, will also be considered. Materials will be purchased for the collection where their content is both age and interest appropriate. As graphic novels are chosen to serve a wide age range of audiences, it is the responsibility of the parents to determine which materials are appropriate for their children.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>In total, Douglas County Libraries has no control over information accessed through the Internet. Douglas County Libraries cannot be held responsible for its content. As with other library materials, supervision or restriction of a child's access to the Internet is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian. It is also the responsibility of the child, whose curiosity is surely tempered by his or her judgment and upbringing. Much of the information on the Internet is timely, useful, and/or entertaining. Some of it is dated, erroneous or offensive. This is also the case with printed materials. Library users should cast a cautious and critical eye on any and all data they discover. The job of the library is access, not endorsement.</p>
